GLM_functions_calculate_predictors.R : script with all the functions created to process the raw data into:
                                       - segments with a given number of roadkills each (response variable)
                                       - covariates (segment road type, percentage woodland cover)

GLM_data_calculation_&_processing.R : script to compute the response variable and covariates for the GLM
                                      using the functions from GLM_functions_calculate_predictors.R
